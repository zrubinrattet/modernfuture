Try using standard emails (Gmail/Yahoo/Hotmail and etc.) or an email which uses the same domain as the website
Check with your hosting provider whether you have your PHP mail activated or not.

Similar to the first instructions you should add the created shortcode into the pages and posts, where you want the contact form to appear. The shortcode list can be copied from the Manager section in Contact Form Builder> Manager
